  title: "Journalism: because stories don't tell themselves"
  subtitle: Interviewer, storyteller, editor
  description: >
    It’s tough to say no to a great assignment. As a result, I’ve been lucky enough to turn in pieces and/or hold down posts at The Village Voice, Refinery29, The WILD, Earnshaw’s, Oakazine, and more.

  title: "Copywriting: getting paid to be pithy"
  subtitle: Wordsmith
  description: >
    I have a knack for crafting copy that catches the eye—think snappy merchandise descriptions, punchy one-sheets, emails that don’t get deleted—for businesses large and small, e.g. Flat Vernacular, Love Adorned, and more.

  title: "Content production: or, making the vision materialize"
  subtitle: Transcriber, scriptwriter, concept editor
  description: >
    When the written word doesn’t take center stage, I work behind the scenes. From to man-on-the-street segments to brand concept videos to documentary interview transcriptions, I love to take cool ideas and bring them to life.
